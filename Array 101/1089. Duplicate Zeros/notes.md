I spent well over 4 hours on this problem total, spread out in multiple days. Not that worth it for an Easy problem.
(But now I wonder if this should be an Easy problem tho, from the same feeling in Discussion section.)

A better practice:
* Think out loud. Explain to yourself as you think.
* Better to finish first with a naive approach then try to improve on it, rather than trying in hours to find an optimal solution at first try.

@Yerkon this problem was 4 points in the contest 141, so it's on the right side. Medium problems start from 5 points.

I found that sometimes I spent more time on Easy problems than on Medium. I believe that the difficulty is related to figuring out the approach, not the implementation. Therefore, the implementation for Easy problems can be tricky with bunch of edge cases. For this problem, the tricky edge case was when zero is in the end of the resulting array.
